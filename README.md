Handwritten digit recognition is a classic problem in the field of computer vision and machine learning. It involves identifying the numerical digits from images of handwritten digits.

Handwritten digit recognition is a popular problem in the field of computer vision and machine learning. In this project, we aim to build a multi-class classification system that can recognize handwritten digits from 0 to 9 using Python.

Overall, a handwritten digit recognition project in Python can be a great way to learn about deep learning, computer vision, and image classification techniques. It can also be a useful tool for applications like optical character recognition, digitization of documents, and handwriting analysis.
